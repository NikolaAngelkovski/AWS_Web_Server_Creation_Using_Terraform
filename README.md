# AWS Web Server Creation Using Terraform

This is a simple project that I made using Terraform. The goal of the project was to deploy an Ubuntu server instance in an AWS VPC using Terraform to configure the VPC. The code for the project is in the "main.tf" file. All you need to do to run the code successfully is to create an AWS account, install Visual Studio Code and the Terraform extension made by HashiCorp.
